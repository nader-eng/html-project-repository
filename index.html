      Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
      unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which
      involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the
      former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen.
      'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI)
      while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called
      artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks define the
      field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
      environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
      goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used
      to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans
      associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem
      solving".[4] As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to
      require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a
      phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI
      is whatever hasn't been done yet."[6] For instance, optical character
      recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7]
      having become a routine technology.[8] Modern machine capabilities
      generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human
      speech,[9] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such
      as chess and Go),[10] and also imperfect-information games like poker,[11]
      self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and
      military simulations.[12] Artificial intelligence was founded as an
      academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced
      several waves of optimism,[13][14] followed by disappointment and the loss
      of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[15][16] followed by new approaches,
      success and renewed funding.[14][17] After AlphaGo defeated a professional
      Go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread
      global attention.[18] For most of its history, AI research has been
      divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each
      other.[19] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as
      particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),[20] the use of
      particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep
      philosophical differences.[23][24][25] Sub-fields have also been based on
      social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular
      researchers).[19] The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research
      include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural
      language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate
      objects.[20] AGI is among the field's long-term goals.[26] Approaches
      include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional
      symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and
      mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based
      on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer
      science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics,
      philosophy, and many other fields. The field was founded on the assumption
      that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can
      be made to simulate it".[27] This raises philosophical arguments about the
      mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like
      intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and
      philosophy since antiquity.[32] Some people also consider AI to be a
      danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[33][34] Others believe that
      AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass
      unemployment.[35] In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have
      experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power,
      large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques
      have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve
      many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and
      operations research.[36][17]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in
      antiquity,[37] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's
      Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[38] These characters and their fates
      raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial
      intelligence.[32] The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with
      philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical
      logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested
      that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could
      simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that
      digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known
      as the Church–Turing thesis.[39] Along with concurrent discoveries in
      neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to
      consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed
      changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to "whether
      or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".[40]
      The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and
      Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".[41]
      The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in
      1956,[42] where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John
      McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the
      influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.[43] Attendees Allen Newell
      (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and
      Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.[44]
      They and their students produced programs that the press described as
      "astonishing":[45] computers were learning checkers strategies (c.
      1954)[46] (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average
      human),[47] solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems
      (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.[48] By the
      middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the
      Department of Defense[49] and laboratories had been established around the
      world.[50] AI's founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon
      predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any
      work a man can do". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation
      ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially
      be solved".[13] They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the
      remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism
      of Sir James Lighthill[51] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to
      fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut
      off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called
      an "AI winter",[15] a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was
      difficult. In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial
      success of expert systems,[52] a form of AI program that simulated the
      knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for
      AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth
      generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to
      restore funding for academic research.[14] However, beginning with the
      collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into
      disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.[16] The development
      of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in
      the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the
      development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the
      1980s. A landmark publication in the field was the 1989 book Analog VLSI
      Implementation of Neural Systems by Carver A. Mead and Mohammed
      Ismail.[53] In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used
      for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.[36] The
      success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law and
      transistor count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties
      between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and
      mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and
      scientific standards.[54] Deep Blue became the first computer
      chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry
      Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[55] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition
      match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest
      Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant
      margin.[56] Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to
      large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception;
      data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks
      around 2012.[57] The Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for
      the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy
      AI research[58] as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.[59]
      In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go
      champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat
      a professional Go player without handicaps.[10][60] In the 2017 Future of
      Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie,[61] who at the time
      continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[62][63] Deep
      Blue's Murray Campbell called AlphaGo's victory "the end of an era...
      board games are more or less done[64] and it's time to move on."[65] This
      marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of
      Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game, more so than
      Chess. AlphaGo was later improved, generalized to other games like chess,
      with AlphaZero;[66] and MuZero[67] to play many different video games,
      that were previously handled separately,[68] in addition to board games.
      Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a
      superhuman level, Pluribus (poker bot)[69] and Cepheus (poker bot).[11]
      See: General game playing. According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a
      landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software
      projects that use AI within Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in
      2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data
      indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error
      rates in image processing tasks.[70] He attributes this to an increase in
      affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing
      infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[17]
      Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system
      that can automatically translate from one language to another and
      Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.[70] In a 2017
      survey, one in five companies reported they had "incorporated AI in some
      offerings or processes".[71][72] Around 2016, China greatly accelerated
      its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly
      increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to
      becoming an "AI superpower".[73][74] By 2020, Natural Language Processing
      systems such as the enormous GPT-3 (then by far the largest artificial
      neural network) were matching human performance on pre-existing
      benchmarks, albeit without the system attaining commonsense understanding
      of the contents of the benchmarks.[75] DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 (2020)
      demonstrated the ability to determine, in hours rather than months, the 3D
      structure of a protein. Facial recognition advanced to where, under some
      circumstances, some systems claim to have a 99%
