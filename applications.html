    <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology
      can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being
      tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different
      treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.
      Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers
      that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh
      the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the
      end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving
      cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute
      it to act in a way that prevents a collision. Artificial intelligence also
      has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and
      flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and
      large account depositsâ€”all of which help a bank's fraud department.
      Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make
      trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of
      securities easier to estimate.

    <h2>Categorization of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak
      and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to
      carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as
      the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's
      Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it
      for you. Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on
      the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and
      complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which
      they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene.
      These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars
      or in hospital operating rooms.

    <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from
      scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that
      machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to
      keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an
      exponential rate. Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy
      and even be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial
      intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be
      treated with the same rights as humans. Self-driving cars have been fairly
      controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest
      possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of
      colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would
      calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage. Another
      contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it
      may affect human employment. With many industries looking to automate
      certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern
      that people would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may
      remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may
      easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more
      obsolete.
