    <h2>Social intellegence</h2>
    <p>
      Moravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social
      intelligence.[147][148] Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous
      vehicles remains a difficult problem.[149] Affective computing is an
      interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize,
      interpret, process, or simulate human affects.[150][151][152] Moderate
      successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment
      analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal
      sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a
      videotaped subject.[153] In the long run, social skills and an
      understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a
      social agent. The ability to predict the actions of others by
      understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to
      make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and
      expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human
      interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.[154]
      Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak
      conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve
      users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer
      agents actually are.[155]

    <h2>General intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Historically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the
      massive Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982–1992)
      attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. These early projects
      failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models
      and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain
      AI. Nowadays, most current AI researchers work instead on tractable
      "narrow AI" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile
      navigation).[156] Many researchers predict that such "narrow AI" work in
      different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a
      machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the
      narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding
      human ability in most or all these areas.[26][157] Many advances have
      general, cross-domain significance. One high-profile example is that
      DeepMind in the 2010s developed a "generalized artificial intelligence"
      that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed
      a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential
      learning.[158][159][160] Besides transfer learning,[161] hypothetical AGI
      breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures
      that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out how
      to "slurp up" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured
      Web.[162] Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered)
      conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, "Master
      Algorithm" could lead to AGI.[163] Finally, a few "emergent" approaches
      look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that
      anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child
      development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence
      emerges.[164][165] Many of the problems in this article may also require
      general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as
      people do. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine
      translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages
      (NLP), follow the author's argument (reason), know what is being talked
      about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent
      (social intelligence). A problem like machine translation is considered
      "AI-complete", because all of these problems need to be solved
      simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.

    <h2>Motion and manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      AI is heavily used in robotics.[138] Advanced robotic arms and other
      industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from
      experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and
      gear slippage.[139] A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and
      visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its
      environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the
      interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge. Motion
      planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into "primitives"
      such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant
      motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact
      with an object.[140][141][142] Moravec's paradox generalizes that
      low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are,
      counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is
      named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively
      easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence
      tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the
      skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and
      mobility".[143][144] This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers,
      physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for
      millions of years.[145]
