    <h2>Language Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Natural language processing[130] (NLP) allows machines to read and
      understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language
      processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the
      acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as
      newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language
      processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering
      and machine translation.[131] Many current approaches use word
      co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text.
      "Keyword spotting" strategies for search are popular and scalable but
      dumb; a search query for "dog" might only match documents with the literal
      word "dog" and miss a document with the word "poodle". "Lexical affinity"
      strategies use the occurrence of words such as "accident" to assess the
      sentiment of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all
      these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy
      at the page or paragraph level. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of
      "narrative" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense
      reasoning.[132] By 2019, transformer-based deep learning architectures
      could generate coherent text.[133]

    <h2>Perception</h2>
    <p>
      Machine perception[134] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as
      cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and
      active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the
      world. Applications include speech recognition,[135] facial recognition,
      and object recognition.[136] Computer vision is the ability to analyze
      visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall
      pedestrian far away may produce the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized
      pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and
      reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its
      "object model" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.[137]

    <h2>Motion and manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      AI is heavily used in robotics.[138] Advanced robotic arms and other
      industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from
      experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and
      gear slippage.[139] A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and
      visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its
      environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the
      interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge. Motion
      planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into "primitives"
      such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant
      motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact
      with an object.[140][141][142] Moravec's paradox generalizes that
      low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are,
      counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is
      named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively
      easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence
      tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the
      skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and
      mobility".[143][144] This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers,
      physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for
      millions of years.[145]
